# QuantumElevator
Quantum Elevator is a Roblox game where you test out weapons to blow up baddies, collect nanite and then
use the nanite to get even better weapons! Level up, improve stats, get armor, and see how deep into
the Quantum Elevators you can go!

This is essentially the design document and issue tracker for implementing the ideas here into the game itself.

The game itself can be found [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/14807778375/Quantum-Elevator) and any questions
